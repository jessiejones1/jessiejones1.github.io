      <p class="noindent upup bold">I am not a stranger to an existential crisis every once in a while, they are usually experienced when I am lying in bed trying to get to sleep or when I am having a deep conversation with friend’s.</p>

      <p class="noindent">But, as of late they have been caused by the topic of space and have been happening more often because of this new-found addiction to podcasts. I stumbled upon a podcast created by Bill Nye and his colleague Corey S. Pell where they discuss anything and everything that involves science (which is quite literally, everything) and one recurring topic is space, it’s contents and just how damn huge it is.</p>

      <p>I don’t know how often a “normal” person has existential crisis’; is it more than once a week? Maybe I just have too much time on my hands and I spend a lot of that time in my own mind, thinking about too many things that are bigger than my existence alone and now that I’ve added conversations held by people who are known for their smart’s, I find that I simply don’t know what to do with myself.</p>
      
      <p>One thing that really got me going is the planet known as Europa. It is the largest out of Jupiter’s moons and the outer crust is made entirely out of ice. This in itself is impressive, but this isn’t what made my jaw drop. The fact that the next layer underneath of this giant icy sphere is entirely ocean is what made my mind explode just a little (it then has a rocky interior and then an iron core). I don’t know if people have the same reaction as me finding out that a planet like this exists, but I don’t really care. I think it’s amazing and I’m never going to stop thinking otherwise. The fact that space exists is mind blowing enough as it is, but when you dive deeper into its contents it can sometimes be hard to comprehend it.</p>

      <p class="quoteup">If you haven’t got any ounce of interest in science, what is wrong with you?</p>

      <p class="noindent bold">Whenever I hear about these kinds of things or think about them, I have a moment where I just seem to zoom out and see my existence from a greater perspective.<br><br><br></p>

      <p class="noindent">I am both fascinated and filled with this kind of deep rooted dread whenever this happens, and I believe that this comes with any being who is painfully self-aware of their own humanity. Everything is temporary, and we get a miniscule amount of time on this earth compared to a lot of other things. Like does a 120-year-old tortoise know just how lucky it is? I know a man who was born in 1923 and with him being 97 of course he was but I didn’t really think about it until I did the maths, to think of all of the things that he has lived through and the stories that he could tell. But, when thinking of this, I am only 22 and currently living in a global pandemic; so, I guess that will be a pretty cool story to tell the future generations. Plus, they will probably have to learn about it in school at some point? That’s pretty crazy to think about. Obviously, a global pandemic that only really effects humans is only going to affect the things that we have built in order to keep our economy running and our health.</p>

      <p>I don’t really have the same zoom-out reaction when I think of the pandemic, maybe I will one day when I look back at it and really think about it. But, for now I’m going to stick to melting my mind over things that are bigger than the human race because we are already self-centred enough as it is.</p>
