      <p class="quote">As of early 2020, I found that I had fallen out of love with my university course and I have since been on hiatus.</p>

      <p class="noindent up">I actually wasn’t surprised that this had happened, as it seems to be a common occurrence with me whenever I try to turn a hobby into a potential career. The constant and nagging flow of due dates and percentages deciding the worth of my writing eventually took away the joy and release I felt when I chose to put my thoughts to paper. The exact same thing happened to me during the years of 2015 and 2016, when I was completing VCE and the demand of filling my art portfolio and completing finals eventually overtook and consumed my original intentions to handle pigment with paintbrushes.</p>

      <p>So in short, this is a regular thing for me and trying to find exactly why I am like this is still somewhat of a mystery. But I have one theory. When we have a hobby that we choose to put time and effort into, we see it as an escape, as a way to put aside all of the monotonous motions of every-day life that can lead to stress and burnout. When this hobby has value placed upon it outside of our own minds and is put into a system where it is judged based on strict criteria that is very specific and where it’s value is dictated by the one who is marking it, of course we are going to place it into the same box of things that add to our stress and we may even learn to despise it. We learn to see it as a task that places value on your talent and whether or not it is good enough, and some of us associate this with self-worth. Basing self-worth on a number is not healthy and unfortunately I have fallen victim to this before. <br><br><br><br><br></p>

      <p class="noindent bold bold1">I saw me taking a break from my university course as way of keeping my love for writing in-tack as it was barely holding on by a few threads. I have instead chosen to find something else for now (because who knows how I’ll feel going into the new year). <br><br><br><br><br></p>

      <p class="noindent"> Choosing to do this at 22 years old when many of my own friends have finished uni or are in their final year is a bit unnerving. Yes, I am young and still have many years of mucking around trying to find my purpose and doing dumb young adult things, but it is still a little scary feeling like you are well behind in what appears to be an important milestone. We are told from an incredibly young age that university is the path you should take if you ever want to make something out of yourself, that a higher education is what you need if you ever want to be successful. I am trying to unlearn this by listening to my needs instead of trying to push for something that I used to want.</p>

      <p>I don’t know if I’ll ever have a career involved in the creative arts, I’m not really sure if I’d want to. I know that it was something that I wanted when I was 18, but 18 year old me is very different from the me that I am today. I know that I’ll continue to write and paint because it is things that I love doing. But they are things that I love doing for me without any criteria to follow or a number given to it upon completion, maybe I could pursue a creative career outside of a university degree. I still have a passion for learning so I’m not planning on completely pushing aside my education in university, I am just currently searching for something that I know will be better suited for the person that I am today.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
