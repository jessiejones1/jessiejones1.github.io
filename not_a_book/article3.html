    <h3 class="h3mobile">A pit-stop in extroverted land.</h3>

    <div class="bulk">
      <p class="quote">I love being at home. Home is my happy place and where I am completely relaxed, where I can binge watch movies and television shows and spend hours on end drawing and writing. I love small gatherings with close friends and going out to the occasional restaurant. Sometimes I even feel like going out to the city, doesn’t happen often, but it does happen.</p>

      <p class="noindent up">The thing is, I am a self-proclaimed introvert who sometimes decides to stray off that said path and make a quick pit-stop in extroverted land. It is only ever a very brief and rather uncomfortable pit-stop, but most times it is either needed or wanted.</p>

      <p class="noindent down">For instance, I wanted to take a leap into the extroverted world when I met my now partner. I was brave and took massive bounds outside of what my small circle of comfort provided to take a chance in something that I was originally doing as a “f**k it” moment, never thought that something serious could come out of it but knew that I wouldn’t mind if something serious did. I had a drunk friend convince me at a bar a couple of years ago to download a dating app (I won’t say its name, but it is known as a key aid in hook up culture) at a moment of weakness and then I was out on a date within a couple of weeks of having it. And that was it, we have been together for over 2 years now.</p>

    <div class="bulk push">
      <p class="noindent downdown">My partner is one of those people who just seems to get along with everyone and has the ability to make others like him within a few minutes of simply speaking to them (if he was to read this he will probably disagree, but he is wrong). It took me next to no time to realise that he is approximately 5,000 times more extroverted and confident then what I will probably ever be. At first this was intimidating, seeing this dude be so laid back and relaxed in a social environment with loud music and people being all up in your personal space and acting like it was just another day. The relationship he has with his mates is something out of television shows or movies, where they talk almost daily whether that would be via social media, gaming or seeing each other in person just to kick a ball around. Before covid, he would see most of them multiple times during the week because of sporting commitments and then on the weekends just for beers or a game night. 

      <p class="quote">Trying to keep up with his social life gives me whiplash sometimes and at first, I was genuinely confused as to how he found the energy to see most of his mates in a 7-day time span and then do it all over again.</p> 

      <p class="noindent">I understand that you always make time for the people that you love but for me and my mates I can genuinely go weeks without seeing them and be perfectly fine with it. This doesn’t mean that I love them any less, I just don’t see the need for it and I know that I would be exhausted both mentally and physically by the time the week came to its end.</p>

      <p class="quote dots">I am quiet; he isn’t so much. He is incredibly switched on; my head is in the clouds. He is a go-getter; I am a pro procrastinator. He thrives around people; I am a wallflower. </p>

      <p class="noindent">All of these things are stark opposites, but yet we are able to coexist without much difficulty. Yes, he gets on my nerves occasionally and I definitely get on his nerves more, but we just seem to work. He makes me want to get out of my stupidly small comfort zone and I’d like to think that I have made him slow down at times or at least made him think about slowing down. We make each other smile and we are consistent in our efforts to understand and communicate with each other, and that’s why I think we work so well and why I believe we will continue to work out. I also think luck has played a huge part in it, but not everyone believes in luck.
