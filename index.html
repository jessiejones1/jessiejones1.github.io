    <div class="about-me">about me.</div>

    <div class="info-me">
      I’m an almost graduated Monash University Communication Design and Business, Marketing Major from Melbourne Australia. I am passionate about layout design and all it has to offer. With the support of university, I have had a great opportunity to try any great areas, including website design. My work in website design is a little scratchy however that is all a part of the charm.

        <div class=" body info-task content down">
          These have been created throughout the semester starting with xyz progressing to image nets and then eventually not a book.
        </div> 
        <div class="xyz-task heading">xyz</div> 
        <div class="info-xyz content">
          For xyz the focus was random computer generation. I have chosen the political slogan “Make America Great Again” coined by American ex President Donald Trump. I thought it would be interesting and controversial to change the words “America”, “Great” and the name of the person quoting. Some of the sentences created are incredibly heavy with baggage and some just don’t make sense. The two xyz websites are different versions of just this. These words are completely random. Please note these political leaders did not necessarily say these generated quotes, however they are all based of political ideas past and present.

        <div class="imagenets-task heading">image nets</div> 
        <div class="info-imagenets content">
          For imagenets we explored the idea of internet archives and the primal idea of hunting and gathering; however, with the key difference being this primal action was in the context of the internet. I personally have a fascination of the mundane and overlooked; for this reason, I choose to explore ‘bananas’. <br>
          An interesting concept I learnt about the human race while completing this assignment is the strength of the connection between bananas and the phallic symbol. In fact, this connection is so strong it was a struggle to find decent images of bananas on the internet. <br>
          This image net website allows the user to choose their own adventure. Communicating the concept of a net with everything being connected. Each image allows the opportunity to connect to another image, then to another and then another. The images tell a complicated story, but one that needs to be told of the in's and out's of Banana Production.

        </div> 
        <div class="book-task heading">not a book</div> 
        <div class="info-book content">
          For Not a Book I touched on the style of an internet blog. The use of type is the main focus with layout design being the main concept. The use of similar headings, quotes, and image styles throughout ensures consistency and a strong connection between the different articles. This assignment was a collaboration with a friend and creative writer who wrote Out of Practice, Jupiter Falling and Whiplash purely for this concept. “The Un-conventional” touches on deep connections and experiences of hers that she wished to share, most of which are not so peachy. Following her articles, I designed the ‘handwritten’ style with the suggestion of a diary like format keeping the credibility and feeling of truth alive. Also the website allows for expansion later on to be made more in-depth in the future if she would like to continue with this website design.
